VLBI Imaging Script -- functions
=======================================

This folder contains the growing library of functions for automatic VLBI imaging. 
At this point the ::VLBI_imaging_functions.py:: file contains the used functions. ::VLBI_imaging.py:: is a code with the most simple example: modeling one data file within the same directory. The program fit model components to the (imaged) visibility data and create no output (actually remove it). The script print the fitted model component parameters.

For advanced usage of the library see the example folder!
